`py2lispIDyOM` is an open-source Python package that serves as a unifying Python interface that simplifies and
streamlines the research workflow for running the information dynamics of music [IDyOM](https://github.com/mtpearce/idyom/) model and analyzing output data.
It is broadly aimed at researchers conducting IDyOM-based analysis in Python.

## Getting Started

### 1. Prerequisites: Installing IDyOM

`py2lispIDyOM` requires IDyOM to be installed on the local machine. To start with, please read
the [IDyOM installation page](https://github.com/mtpearce/idyom/wiki/Installation) to appropriately install IDyOM.


We also provided a script to automate the IDyOM installation process (for macOS). Some steps to follow:
  - Download this folder: [install_idyom](https://github.com/xinyiguan/py2lispIDyOM/tree/master/install_idyom).
  - In the terminal, 
    - `cd` to the path the folder "install_idyom/" has been downloaded. For example, `cd Downloads/install_idyom/`
    - Type `bash install_idyom.sh`. You will be prompted to provide 
      - your `Password`, and  
      - to follow the subsequent request `Press Enter to continue.`


### 2. Installing `py2lispIDyOM`

The code is compatible with >= Python 3.9.

It can be installed using pip or directly from the source code. 
Basic installation options include:

- From PyPI using pip: `pip install py2lispIDyOM`
- Download or gitclone this repository



## Functionality and Usage

In summary, py2lispIDyOM has three main functionalities for research workflow:

- Running the IDyOM
- Data preprocessing
- Visualizing IDyOM outputs

Please have a look at the [tutorials](https://github.com/xinyiguan/py2lispIDyOM/tree/master/tutorials/), which guides you through all three basic functionalities of through
examples.

- Data preprocessing: 
  - Extracting data: [2a_data_preprocessing_extracting.ipynb](https://github.com/xinyiguan/py2lispIDyOM/blob/master/tutorials/2a_data_preprocessing_extracting.ipynb)
  - Exporting data: [2b_data_preprocessing_exporting.ipynb](https://github.com/xinyiguan/py2lispIDyOM/blob/master/tutorials/2b_data_preprocessing_exporting.ipynb)
- Visualization: [3_visualizing_outputs.ipynb](https://github.com/xinyiguan/py2lispIDyOM/blob/master/tutorials/3_visualizing_outputs.ipynb)

### Contribution guidelines

We tried to make the code accessible and provide some examples in the tutorials for getting started smoothly. 
But there is still lots of room for better documentation, tutorials and testing. 
Please contact us if you have any questions or encounter bugs. 

You are also welcome to contribute to this project. 
There are just a few [small guidelines](https://xinyiguan.github.io/py2lispIDyOM/how_to_contribute.html#) you need to follow.
